Open Up! aims to support public release and reuse of data. The project will develop a platform to
make procurement easier, more transparent, and efficient. We will use the internationally tested School of Data-model to
involve stakeholders (journalists, companies, civil servants) in the platform development and to coach them in
harvesting and visualizing data.

- A platform prototype visualizing procurement data
- The platform will be co-created in the School of Data, which will coach (a) at least ten public institutions in
publishing and reusing their data, and ten journalists in data reuse and (b) deliver open resources to build wider
capacity in Sweden.
- Recommendations on how to improve access to and reuse of public procurement data in Sweden based on an assessment of
the data published on the platform and on feedback from stakeholders.
