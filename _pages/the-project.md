The Open Procurement Project / Öppen Upphandling is a 15 month project from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2021. It uses a two-pronged approach to create new momentum around procurement innovation, openness, and oversight in Sweden. 

Firstly it will build a template-ready platform which is to serve as a repository of procurement know how gathered by experts and participants over the 15 month period.

Secondarily it uses a School of Data approach to broaden the knowledge of participating professionals who handle the flow of Data, participate collaboratively using a guided discovery approach to build the site and attempt to make this project an incubator for future collaborative data-opening efforts.

Below is a short slide outlining the project:
