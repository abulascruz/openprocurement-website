The Open Procurement Project / Öppen Upphandling is a 15 month project from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2021. It uses a two-pronged approach to create new momentum around procurement innovation, openness, and oversight in Sweden.

Firstly it will build a template-ready platform which is to serve as a repository of procurement know how gathered by experts and participants over the 15 month period.

Secondarily it uses a School of Data approach to broaden the knowledge of participating professionals who handle the flow of Data, participate collaboratively using a guided discovery approach to build the site and attempt to make this project an incubator for future collaborative data-opening efforts.

Below is a short slide outlining the project:

Open Up! aims to support public release and reuse of data. The project will develop a platform to
make procurement easier, more transparent, and efficient. We will use the internationally tested School of Data-model to
involve stakeholders (journalists, companies, civil servants) in the platform development and to coach them in
harvesting and visualizing data.

- A platform prototype visualizing procurement data
- The platform will be co-created in the School of Data, which will coach (a) at least ten public institutions in
publishing and reusing their data, and ten journalists in data reuse and (b) deliver open resources to build wider
capacity in Sweden.
- Recommendations on how to improve access to and reuse of public procurement data in Sweden based on an assessment of
the data published on the platform and on feedback from stakeholders.
