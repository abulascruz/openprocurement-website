Our project's name gives it away: our goal is to open as much procurement data as possible. But we're not doing it for the sake of openness.

Our vision is that releasing this data will greatly improve the work of civil servants inside government agencies, municipalities and regions. Our vision is that it will unleash a wave of innovation, allowing our public sector to be more effective, more collaborative and eventually helping to deliver the next generation of public services to all citizens.

To achieve this, we need you! Yeah you! Whether you're working for an administration, a newspaper or a startup, we're planning to build this project around your needs and wishes.

We're having our first workshop on the 10th of June at 10-12. Send an e-mail to [tonimickiewicz@gmail.com](mailto:tonimickiewicz@gmail.com) to register!
