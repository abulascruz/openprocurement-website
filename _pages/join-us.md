Vårt mål är att göra så mycket upphandlingsdata öppet som möjligt! Men varför gör vi det?

Vår vision är att publicera detta data kommer förbättra 
Our vision is that releasing this data will greatly improve the work of civil servants inside government agencies, municipalities and regions. Our vision is that it will unleash a wave of innovation, allowing our public sector to be more effective, more collaborative and eventually helping to deliver the next generation of public services to all citizens.

To achieve this, we need you! Yeah you! Whether you're working for an administration, a newspaper or a startup, we're planning to build this project around your needs and wishes.

We're having a consultation meeting where we will be talking to diverse experts on Thursday, 11 June at 10-12. Send an e-mail to [tonimickiewicz@gmail.com](mailto:tonimickiewicz@gmail.com) to register!
